# clj-vulkan-guide

This is a guide to [Vulkan][], written in the context of [Clojure][] and
[LWJGL][].

You'll need a GPU that supports Vulkan, some familiarity with the Clojure
language, and a Clojure development environment with which you're comfortable.

Vulkan is fairly new and I'm still learning it myself, so this guide is not
authoritative and will probably have mistakes.
