# clj-vulkan-guide

This is a guide to [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), written in the
context of [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) and [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/).

You'll need a GPU that supports Vulkan, some familiarity with the Clojure
language, and a Clojure development environment with which you're comfortable.

Vulkan is fairly new and I'm still learning it myself, so this guide is not
authoritative and will probably have mistakes.
